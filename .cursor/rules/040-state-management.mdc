# State Management (MVP Essentials)

1.  **Server State**: **TanStack Query v5** for all data fetching, caching, and server state synchronization.
    ```typescript
    // const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery({ queryKey: ['todos'], queryFn: fetchTodos });
    ```
2.  **Global UI State**:
    -   **React Context API** for simple, low-frequency global state (e.g., theme).
    -   If Context becomes complex, consider Zustand (but start with Context).
3.  **Local Component State**: `useState` and `useReducer` (for more complex logic). Keep state as local as possible.
4.  **Form State**: **React Hook Form** + `@hookform/resolvers/zod`.
5.  **Principles**:
    -   **Single Source of Truth**.
    -   **Immutability**: Create new state objects/arrays on updates.
