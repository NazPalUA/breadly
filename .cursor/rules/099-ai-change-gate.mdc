# AI-Generated Change Verification (MVP)

After AI edits:

1.  **Lint & Format**: Run `npm run lint`. Fix errors.
2.  **Type Check**: Run `npm run typecheck`. Fix errors.
3.  **Review Logic**:
    -   Does it meet the prompt's requirements?
    -   Does it follow project rules (theme, naming, etc.)?
    -   Any obvious anti-patterns?
