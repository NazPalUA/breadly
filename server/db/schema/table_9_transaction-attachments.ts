TRANSACTION ATTACHMENTS SCHEMA - Junction Table for Document Links
================================================================================
Purpose: Manages the many-to-many relationship between transactions and their
         attachments (receipts, voice messages). Allows multiple transactions
         to reference the same attachment and one transaction to have multiple
         attachments.

Key Features:
- Many-to-many relationship management
- Composite primary key for relationship integrity
- User isolation through transaction ownership validation
- Automatic cleanup on transaction/attachment deletion
- Row-level security for multi-tenant access control

/**
 * Junction table linking transactions to their attachments
 * Many-to-many relationship: one transaction can have multiple attachments,
 * one attachment can be referenced by multiple transactions
 *
 * Business Rules:
 * - Each transaction-attachment pair can only exist once (composite primary key)
 * - Users can only access attachments through their own transactions (RLS)
 * - Cascade deletion when transactions or attachments are removed
 * - Attachment access is controlled by transaction ownership
 * - Supports sharing attachments across multiple transactions (e.g., one receipt for split expenses)
